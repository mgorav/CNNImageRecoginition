Deep Learning CNN for Image Recognition

Deep Learning CNN model which recognizes images. This projects provides generic framework for building image recognition. The framework als uses image augmentation to achieve better results. This program when run locally will take lots of time. Further image size is intentionally chosen less in favour of fast run. Best results will be achieved when ran on GPU. Further accuracy of 85% on the test data was achieved.
